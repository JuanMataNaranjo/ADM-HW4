# ADM-Homework4

The following structure of code has been followed:

1. **Question 1:** Functionality for question 1 is stored in the file hyperloglog.py. 
We have generated a .txt in which we stored all binary values (not uploaded to git) 
and run the hyperloglog estimate over this function.

2. **Question 2:**

3. **Bonus Question:** Functionality for this question can be found in the file
k_means_mapreduce.py. Due to time issues we were not able to apply it over the real
data set and have applied it over an alternative data set instead

4. **Algorithm Question:** The answer to this question can be found in the main.ipynb 
notebook
